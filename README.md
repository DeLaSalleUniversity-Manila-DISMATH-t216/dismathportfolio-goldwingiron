# dismathportfolio-goldwingiron

##Week 1
- I was introduced to a complicated but fun subject Discrete Mathematics (DISMATH)
- We were given the basics to DISMATH which are Mathematical Proofs, Propositions, and Logical Deductions
- We also learned about Propositional Variables (Not,And,Or,xOr,If then,Iff), their symbols, and how to use them in the Truth Table

##Week 2
- I learned about the Logical Equivalences and Proof by Truth Table which are:
  - Identity Laws
 - Domination Laws
 - Negation Laws
 - Double Negation Laws
 - Idempotent Laws
 - Commutative Laws
 - Associative Laws
 - Distributive Laws
 - De Morgan's Laws
 - Absorption Laws
 - Equivalence
- I also had a hard time arguing and proving that Superman doesn't exist

##Week 3
- I learned about Predicate Logic that teaches us to tackle an argument not as a whole but in terms of subject and predicate
- We were also introduced to Quantifiers, Existential Quantifier ("There Exist") and Universal Quantifier ("For All"), to simplify general arguments 
- We also learned about the Rules of Inference which are:
 - Modus Ponens 
 - Modus Tollens 
 - Hypothetical Syllogism
 - Disjunctive Syllogism
 - Addition
 - Simplification
 - Conjunction
 - Resolution
- We also found out its basic components which are Argument, Validity, and Pattern
- It also must have a Tautology which must be true in every argument

##Week 4
- We were introduced to Proofs and its following methods:
 - Direct Proof
 - Proof by Contraposition
 - Vacuous and Trivial Proof
 - Proof by Contradiction
 - Proof by Equivalence
- We also learned about Mathematical Induction which proves mathematical theorems
- We were also introduced to Base and Recursive Functions

 
##Week 5
- We were introduced to Recursive Algorithms and its applications. A Recursive Algorithm is a way to shorten problems that have a repeating attribute and shortening them to a smaller problem for faster solving and understanding.
- Program Correctness was also discussed to us wherein you test an equation/algorithm/program if it can produce a correct output with its possible inputs.
- This week, we were also introduced to the concept of sets
  - A set is and unordered collection of elements
  - An empty set is a set containing no elements denoted by { } or âˆ…
  - Set builder notation is an organized way of representing sets in a mathematical way
  - Subsets is a set that is contained in another bigger set
  - Cardinality of a set is the number of elements a particular set contains
- We were also taught the Set operations which looks very similiar to the logical equivalences and also works the same way

##Week 6
- We were introduced to Functions.
- A function is an assignment of exactly one element of B to each element of A.
- It has 3 types, One-to-one, Onto, and Bijection
- We had a review on the topic of Nested Quantifiers for our first quiz in DISMATH


##Week 7
- FREE CUT!!!


##Week 8
- This week were introduced to the most important topic in DISMATH, Algorithms
- The pseudocode of an Algorithm was also introduced. It is a way of presenting an algorithm using the syntax of a programming language, but is intended for human reading.
- We were also given a glimpse of a simple algorithm. It is all about finding the maximum element in a given input using a finite set of integers


##Week 9
- We were given time to study most of the simple and fundamental algorithms so we can fully understand the concepts. These algorithms were the Linear Search, Binary Search, Bubble Sort, Insertion Sort, and the Greedy Change Algorithm.
 - *Linear Search* - finds a particular value in a list that checks each element in sequence until the desired element is found
 - *Binary Search* - compares the middle values of a list then repeated until the desired output is found
 - *Bubble Sort* - compares the first two elements then interchanging them if they are in the incorrect order
 - *Insertion Sort* - compares the second element with the first and inserts it before the first element if it is less, otherwise inserted after
 - *Insertion Sort* - chooses the number of coins per denomination using the least total number of coins

##Week 10
- The growth of functions and time complexity was discussed to us this week
  - This topic is about finding the number of comparisons a function/algorithm/program makes and the time it takes before getting the output.
  - This topic is important because it gives programmers an idea their program will do its job.
- The Big-O notation represents the upperbound function of a program, while the big-omega represents the lower bound, and big-theta represents the upper and lower bounds.
