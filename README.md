##Week 1
- I was introduced to a complicated but fun subject Discrete Mathematics (DISMATH)
- We were given the basics to DISMATH which are Mathematical Proofs, Propositions, and Logical Deductions
- We also learned about Propositional Variables (Not,And,Or,xOr,If then,Iff), their symbols, and how to use them in the Truth Table

##Week 2
- I learned about the Logical Equivalences and Proof by Truth Table which are:
  - Identity Laws
 - Domination Laws
 - Negation Laws
 - Double Negation Laws
 - Idempotent Laws
 - Commutative Laws
 - Associative Laws
 - Distributive Laws
 - De Morgan's Laws
 - Absorption Laws
 - Equivalence
- I also had a hard time arguing and proving that Superman doesn't exist

##Week 3
- I learned about Predicate Logic that teaches us to tackle an argument not as a whole but in terms of subject and predicate
- We were also introduced to Quantifiers, Existential Quantifier ("There Exist") and Universal Quantifier ("For All"), to simplify general arguments 
- We also learned about the Rules of Inference which are:
 - Modus Ponens 
 - Modus Tollens 
 - Hypothetical Syllogism
 - Disjunctive Syllogism
 - Addition
 - Simplification
 - Conjunction
 - Resolution
- We also found out its basic components which are Argument, Validity, and Pattern
- It also must have a Tautology which must be true in every argument
