##Week 1
- I was introduced to a complicated but fun subject Discrete Mathematics (DISMATH)
- We were given the basics to DISMATH which are Mathematical Proofs, Propositions, and Logical Deductions
- We also learned about Propositional Variables (Not,And,Or,xOr,If then,Iff), their symbols, and how to use them in the Truth Table

##Week 2
- I learned about the Logical Equivalences and Proof by Truth Table which are:
  - Identity Laws
 - Domination Laws
 - Negation Laws
 - Double Negation Laws
 - Idempotent Laws
 - Commutative Laws
 - Associative Laws
 - Distributive Laws
 - De Morgan's Laws
 - Absorption Laws
 - Equivalence
